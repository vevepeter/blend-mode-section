# Blend Mode Section

Simple Section that shows an image and a header, and mixes them together using blend modes.

To run the code yourself head on over to the [Vev Developer docs](https://developer.vev.design/docs/cli/commands) for setting up the CLI. There's no need to create a new Widget, but `vev init` is required.

Do what you want with this code, steal, change, sell, whatever.
